# polder-schema.org-template

The goal of POLDER is to facilitate single-window metadata search in support of polar science and research communities. POLDER is encouraging data holders to generate schema.org metadata descriptions to support this goal. The polder-schema.org-template repository on github has been created to foster community agreement on [documentation](https://github.com/POLDER-Crew/polder-schema.org-template/tree/master/Documentation) and [examples](https://github.com/POLDER-Crew/polder-schema.org-template/tree/master/Examples) for implementing schema.org with a focus on the polar community search needs. Wherever possible, our examples and guidance documents will draw from the [ESIP Science on Schema.org guidelines](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org).

We welcome and encourage community contributions to the work, including revisions to documentation and examples as well as suggestions for new helpful resources that we could be working on.  Community members are invited to contribute through:

- Proposing changes or additions by creating [GitHub issues](https://github.com/POLDER-Crew/polder-schema.org-template/issues)
- Implementing proposed features by editing documents in the repository and generating a [GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
- Participating in discussions within issues and pull requests
