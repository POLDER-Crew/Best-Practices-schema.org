# Best-Practices-schema.org

The goal of POLDER is to facilitate single-window metadata search in support of polar science and research communities. POLDER is encouraging data holders to generate schema.org metadata descriptions to support this goal. The Best-Practices-schema.org repository on github has been created to foster community agreement on [documentation](https://github.com/POLDER-Crew/polder-schema.org-template/tree/master/Documentation) and [examples](https://github.com/POLDER-Crew/Best-Practices-schema.org/tree/master/Examples) for implementing schema.org with a focus on the polar community search needs. Wherever possible, our examples and guidance documents will draw from the [ESIP Science on Schema.org guidelines](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org).

We welcome and encourage community contributions to the work, including revisions to documentation and examples as well as suggestions for new helpful resources that we could be working on.  Community members are invited to contribute through:

- Proposing changes or additions by creating [GitHub issues](https://github.com/POLDER-Crew/Best-Practices-schema.org/issues)
- Implementing proposed features by editing documents in the repository and generating a [GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
- Participating in discussions within issues and pull requests

# Executive Summary
This document aims to utilize schema.org for the Polar data management community. The community has agreed on and plans on implementing uniform best practices for documenting data, observing assets, and other entities. Extensive work has been conducted under both the Earth Science Information Partnership Science-on-schema.org group and the Research Data Alliance to develop approaches and guidelines for interoperable metadata practices. While the current Science-on-schema.org guidelines provide a strong technical basis for harmonized use of the schema.org vocabulary, they do not make specific requirements for minimal acceptable metadata nor for specific types of metadata requirements for key polar research use cases. This document assembles data discovery use cases and requirements for polar data discovery that represent a target set of features for the POLDER federated search system. Use cases specifically elucidate and prioritize the functional uses of the federated data discovery platform, which will in turn be used to articulate a specific list of metadata requirements needed to implement a discovery system that provides those features.

# Use cases
Use cases will be logged and updated in the POLDER-crew/use-case repository. This can be found at the main POLDER-Crew directory.
