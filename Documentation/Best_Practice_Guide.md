# Introduction:
## Why a guide is needed

Previous experience with implementing metadata standards in the polar data management community has demonstrated that there are as many ways to write metadata as there are metadata authors. The end result of many parallel metadata writing efforts is difficulty in brokering the various flavours of each metadata standard. 

With schema.org being relatively young technology in the scientific data management field, we have the opportunity to collectively agree on some core principles of best practice before too many data centres have implemented it.
